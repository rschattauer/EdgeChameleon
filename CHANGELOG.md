## [Snapshot]

[Snapshot]: https://github.com/rschattauer/EdgeChameleon/commits/develop

First release. Compose Multiplatform library that switches the status bar and navigation bar icons between light and
dark, based on the content behind the bars.

**New**

- `Modifier.edgeChameleon()` samples the content behind the bars and sets the icons to the colour with the better
  contrast. Options: `enabled`, `forcedIcons`, `statusBar`, `navigationBar` and `state`
- `EdgeChameleonState` holds the current `statusBarIcons` and `navigationBarIcons` as Compose state; `BarIcons` has the
  values `Light` and `Dark`
- Experimental (`@ExperimentalEdgeChameleonApi`): `EdgeChameleonTuning` with the sampling rate, cell count, contrast
  threshold, hysteresis and zone weights, and `EdgeChameleonState.collectCells` with the sampled cells
- Android 9 (API 28) and newer: the content is sampled after it changes, at most 10 times per second and not at all on
  a static screen; each bar is reduced to 16 cells that vote for the icon colour with the better contrast
- Android: sampling pauses while another window has the focus; a full-screen `Dialog` has its own bars, so the modifier
  goes on its content as well; with gesture navigation the navigation bar is not handled; the navigation bar contrast
  scrim is turned off while the modifier is active; disabling or removing the modifier restores the original icons
- Android below 9, iOS, macOS, desktop (JVM), web (JS and Wasm): the modifier only draws the content, the options have
  no effect
- Targets: Android (minSdk 23), iOS (arm64 and simulator arm64), macOS arm64, JVM, JS and Wasm
- The public API is checked against `edgechameleon/api` in CI
