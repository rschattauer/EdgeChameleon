# Contributing to EdgeChameleon

Thank you for your interest in EdgeChameleon. Issues, pull requests and ideas are welcome.

- Search the existing issues before you file a bug.
- For a large change, open an issue first and describe what you plan.
- Be kind: see the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Report security problems privately, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Development setup

| For | You need |
|---|---|
| Library, unit tests, web and desktop targets | JDK 21 (the Gradle wrapper is included) |
| Android, sample app, device tests | Android SDK with platform 37 (`ANDROID_HOME`), an emulator or a device for the device tests |
| iOS and macOS targets | macOS with Xcode |

```bash
./gradlew :edgechameleon:testAndroidHostTest :edgechameleon:jvmTest      # unit tests
./gradlew :edgechameleon:connectedAndroidDeviceTest                      # device tests, on a running emulator or device
./gradlew :edgechameleon:compileKotlinJs :edgechameleon:compileKotlinWasmJs
./gradlew :edgechameleon:compileKotlinIosArm64 :edgechameleon:compileKotlinIosSimulatorArm64 :edgechameleon:compileKotlinMacosArm64   # macOS
./gradlew :sample:androidApp:installDebug                                # the sample app
./gradlew ktfmtCheck ktfmtCheckScripts                                   # formatting
./gradlew :edgechameleon:checkKotlinAbi                                  # the public API against edgechameleon/api
./scripts/check-hygiene.sh                                               # no secrets or personal paths in tracked files
actionlint                                                               # the workflows
```

Format the code with `./gradlew ktfmtFormat ktfmtFormatScripts`; CI fails on unformatted files. The style is
[ktfmt](https://github.com/facebook/ktfmt) (kotlinlang style). The public API is explicit (`explicitApi()`): after a
deliberate change of it, run `./gradlew :edgechameleon:updateKotlinAbi` and commit the changed dump in
`edgechameleon/api`. Functions have a block body, not an expression body.

## Repository layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `edgechameleon/` | The library: `commonMain` (modifier, node, bar decision, throttle), `androidMain` (pixel readback, window bars), `nonAndroidMain` (no-op implementation), unit tests in `commonTest`, device tests in `androidDeviceTest` |
| `edgechameleon/api/` | Dump of the public API, checked in CI |
| `sample/` | Sample Android app with a debug panel (`androidApp`) and its shared Compose code (`shared`) |
| `docs/images/` | Screenshots of the README |
| `scripts/` | `check-hygiene.sh` (secret scan) and `release-notes.sh` (notes of a release from `CHANGELOG.md`) |

The Maven artifact is `dev.schattauer.edgechameleon:edgechameleon`.

## Branches and continuous integration

Work happens on `develop`, and pull requests target `develop`. `main` only holds released code and is moved by the
maintainer when a release is made, see [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md). The CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every pull
request and on `develop` and `main`: hygiene (secret scan, actionlint), formatting, unit tests, compilation of the web
targets and the Android sample, compilation of the Apple targets and the check of the public API. Device tests are not
part of the CI: run them on an emulator when you change the sampling or the window handling.

## Pull requests

1. Fork the repository and create a topic branch from `develop`.
2. Add or update tests for your change.
3. Make sure the commands above pass.
4. Update `README.md` and the `Snapshot` section of [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) when users can notice the change. A
   breaking change of the public API needs a new minor version while the version is `0.x`, and a new major version after
   1.0.
5. Describe what changed and how you tested it.

## Commit messages

To keep the history readable at a glance, a commit message is one line that says precisely what changed, 100 characters
at most.

## Screenshots and examples

Use neutral content. Do not commit real customer names, account data, API keys or screenshots of real apps.
